# vpprompt


###Purpose of this addon

Simplest and most ideal method for renaming selected objects:

* begin by pressing a hotkey  
* type the name you wish to give  
* finish by pressing enter (or cancel by pressing escape).

One should not have to click with a mouse or worry whether a such-and-such panel is open to even have a place to click.

Wouldn't it be also nice if the name of the outer and inner did match ( object and data)?  I thought so too.

#Misc Info

*vpprompt* was originally an addon *shiftsemi* which was bound to a specific hotkey ``:`` and since the name of the addon was the same as the keybind, it seemed sensible to remake as a new addon 'vpprompt', now that I figured out how to make the mapping configurable.
